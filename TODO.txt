BUG: Reloating makes camera behave indeterministic,
     depending on whether google maps or the pilot data load faster.
     Camera should not deactivate when no pilots are online.

- Make offline pilots list prettier
    - add right click menu for offline pilots
    - Start with "offline:". Otherwise GUI is confusing if
      only one pilot is displayed.
      
- Add 'Go to last known position' button to offline pilots

- Grey out non-highlighted pilots instead of hiding them in map
    - Move highlighted pilots to the front on map



- Add optional nosleep.js (and add setting)

- Implement Pilots List
    + Sort: online/offline, distance
    + Multiline or extendable, run some tests
    - UI elements:
        + icon
        + name
        + status
        + altitude/altitude gnd
        + distance, direction
        - (vario)
        - (velocity)
        - (glider)
        + airtime
        + xc kilometer
        + takeoff (- country flag)
        + altitude histogram
    + Make animated
    - Make configurable


- Implement Navigation (for drivers)







ABANDONED:

// - Right click on pilot icon to open context menu (in map)
// Posponed - can't be done easily

- Map: click on pilot -> open details tab on the bottom, showing name,stats,histogram
    - Implement HUD in Map
- Todo: Add filtering on which pilots the camera should focus
    -> Instead, use friendlist

- Add friendlist
    - '+' in pilot list should show friendlist
    - '+' in friendlist should open the current add-pilots list
    -> Replaced with hidden/shown pilots

- Invert highlighting
    - No pilots highlighted: All shown
    - Some pilots highlighted: Only those shown
    - Highlighting Menu: Reset removes all highlights
    - Right-Click menu:
        - Highlight/Don't highlight



DONE:
- Implement title bar
- Add status popover to connectionstate button
- Implement further processing of websocket messages
- Implement pilot selection list
- Implement selected friends (maybe cookies? website specific storage?)
Animation:
- One central animation class
    - Continuously computes the current posiitons/paths with requestAnimationFrame
    - Can be subscribed by useXContestAnimation()
    - Stops updating once no subscribers are left
- The explicit checking of PilotInfo+SubscribedPilots that we did in MapAnimator should get moved into XContestAnimation.
    It should already return only online+subscribed pilots, and should then also include fallback data from PilotInfos
- Add LiveFlightLanded message: {tag: "LiveFlightLanded", flightUuid: "9a9b770b-dfad-4ce5-b089-356e8529bbd9"}
- Finish settings page
- Throttle fps
- Implement path
- Implement low latency mode
- Changing the path length setting might still cause problems with the XContestSocket.
    - Problem: Socket stores oldest data timestamp, but doesnt take into account that tracks that were added later
      are still missing information
    - Solution: Write little helper class for each flight, that determines the data state per-track
- Implement hardware back button in popups
- Add nice icons to map

- MapViewportController:
    - Free camera on drag
    - Catch camera on double click on pilot

+ Visibility:
    + Add to right click menu
    + Implement selector
    + Implement in map

+ Right click menu:
    + move to custom class/file
    + differentiate shown/hidden/offline

- Add own position (GPS) button to map
+ Remember last position of offline pilot

- Import pilots
    Open link with installed PWA:
    https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/integration/webapks
    Add all pilots from link, and set visibility to pilots from link
    
- Export pilots menu
    - Via share
    - Similar to Visibility Selector, maybe copy code
    

Old Notes:
- The markers should be a some kind of arrow / google maps marker with a state symbol inside (double arrow for live, ? for no symbol, some symbol for landed)
    - Normal flight: import NavigationIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Navigation';
                     or import PlayCircleFilledRoundedIcon from '@material-ui/icons/PlayCircleFilledRounded';
    - No response: import HelpIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Help';
    - Landed: import PauseCircleFilledIcon from '@material-ui/icons/PauseCircleFilled';
              or import ArrowDropDownCircleRoundedIcon from '@material-ui/icons/ArrowDropDownCircleRounded';
              or import ArrowDownwardIcon from '@material-ui/icons/ArrowDownward';

- PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS
    - Switch Animated components to class-based, not functional
    - Remove Animation getX, replace with callback registration
    - Let classes themselves decide when they need a full update
    - Same for position
- PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS
    - Add virtual tables
- Add color via string-to-color
- Colorize map paths + icons
- Add distance+direction to pilot selection
- The tracks on the map should have a different color for every pilot
- Sort suggested pilots by distance to self

- Write position callback provider
- Add button that enables/disables GPS (own position)

- Combine screens 1+2 for desktops
- Fix bug where LastFixState changes to 'landed' too early

- Make Pilot InfoWindow Semi-Transparent
- Long click / Right click on pilot to open menu with
    - delete
    - follow
- Fix GPS to actually shut down if disabled in menu

- Add button to switch map type
- Later: Catch camera to group on Follow button press
