- Implement title bar
- Implement further processing of websocket messages
- Implement pilot selection list
- Implement selected friends (maybe cookies? website specific storage?)

Notes:
- The tracks on the map should have a different color for every pilot
- The markers should be a some kind of arrow / google maps marker with a state symbol insight (double arrow for live, ? for no symbol, some symbol for landed)
