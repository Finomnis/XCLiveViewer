- Implement hardware back button in popups

- Map: click on pilot -> open details tab on the bottom, showing name,stats,histogram
- Add nice icons to map
- Colorize map paths + icons
- Add button that enables automatic map scale and position
    - should include all selected pilots + some space
- Add button that enables/disables GPS (own position)
- Add optional nosleep.js (and add setting)

- Implement Pilots List
    - Sort: online/offline, distance
    - Multiline or extendable, run some tests
    - UI elements:
        - name
        - icon
        - airtime
        - (takeoff, country flag)
        - altitude/altitude histogram
        - altitude gnd
        - vario
        - (velocity)

- Add distance+direction and live state to pilot selection (potentially second row)
- Sort suggested pilots by distance to self
- Make ?add=xxx url that automatically adds given pilots (without removing existing ones. Replacing can be done by first deleting your own ones and then calling the url)



Notes:
- The tracks on the map should have a different color for every pilot
- The markers should be a some kind of arrow / google maps marker with a state symbol insight (double arrow for live, ? for no symbol, some symbol for landed)
    - Normal flight: import NavigationIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Navigation';
                     or import PlayCircleFilledRoundedIcon from '@material-ui/icons/PlayCircleFilledRounded';
    - No response: import HelpIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Help';
    - Landed: import PauseCircleFilledIcon from '@material-ui/icons/PauseCircleFilled';
              or import ArrowDropDownCircleRoundedIcon from '@material-ui/icons/ArrowDropDownCircleRounded';
              or import ArrowDownwardIcon from '@material-ui/icons/ArrowDownward';


DONE:
- Implement title bar
- Add status popover to connectionstate button
- Implement further processing of websocket messages
- Implement pilot selection list
- Implement selected friends (maybe cookies? website specific storage?)
Animation:
- One central animation class
    - Continuously computes the current posiitons/paths with requestAnimationFrame
    - Can be subscribed by useXContestAnimation()
    - Stops updating once no subscribers are left
- The explicit checking of PilotInfo+SubscribedPilots that we did in MapAnimator should get moved into XContestAnimation.
    It should already return only online+subscribed pilots, and should then also include fallback data from PilotInfos
- Add LiveFlightLanded message: {tag: "LiveFlightLanded", flightUuid: "9a9b770b-dfad-4ce5-b089-356e8529bbd9"}
- Finish settings page
- Throttle fps
- Implement path
- Implement low latency mode
